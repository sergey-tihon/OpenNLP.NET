OpenNLP for .NET [![NuGet Badge](https://buildstats.info/nuget/OpenNLP.NET)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenNLP.NET/)
=====================

`OpenNLP for .NET` is a port of OpenNLP to .NET.

This project contains build scripts that recompile OpenNLP `.jar` packages to .NET assemblies using [IKVM.NET](https://github.com/ikvm-revived/ikvm) and tests that help to be sure that recompiled packages are workable. Recompiled assemblies are available on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenNLP.NET/).

Resources
---------

* .NET samples are available [in tests](https://github.com/sergey-tihon/OpenNLP.NET/blob/master/tests/OpenNLP.NET.Tests/Tests.cs). 
* [Apache OpenNLP Developer Documentation](https://opennlp.apache.org/docs/1.9.3/manual/opennlp.html).

Versioning
----------

Versioning model used for NuGet packages is aligned to versioning used by OpenNLP Team. 
For example, if you get `OpenNLP` package from [OpenNLP site](https://opennlp.apache.org/) with version `1.5.3`, then the NuGet version of this package has a version `1.5.3.x`, where `x` is the greatest that is available on NuGet. Last number is used for internal versioning of .NET assemblies.
